# **Blockchain Data Analysis Project** üöÄ  

## **Overview**  
This project involves analyzing a blockchain dataset to uncover meaningful trends, insights, and patterns. I utilized **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and other key tools to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build visualizations, derive actionable findings and made predictions through the use of Machine Learning. This work demonstrates my proficiency in **data wrangling**, **analysis**, **data visualization**, and **Machine Learning Predictions** as well as my ability to work with large datasets to solve real-world problems.
